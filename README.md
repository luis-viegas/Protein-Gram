# Protein Gram

ProteinGram is a social network dedicated to people who work out, whether at home or in a gym, with its main goal being to provide an easier way for these people to connect and  cultivate friendships within the community, further inspiring each other with their progress. Right from the start, a team of administrators is defined, this team will ensure everyone sticks to community guidelines and social norms regarding public behavior are followed.

This project was developed in the ene of 2021 as part of the Database and Web Applications course at FEUP.

During the development learned about a lot of technologies that were new for us like HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Laravel, Bootstrap, Docker and Pusher Notifications.

We also learned a lot about project specification, project requirements and project management.


Learn more about the project [Requirements Specification](./docs./ER.md), how we designed and implemented our [Database](./docs./EBD.md), some specifications of our [web routes and requests](./docs./EAP.md) and a small [projet presentation](./docs./PA.md)
